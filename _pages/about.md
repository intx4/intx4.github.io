Hello, I am Francesco. I currently serve as a Junior Security Research Engineer at Huawei, where I explore various solutions for confidential computing. My role involves researching and evaluating both hardware-based and software-based approaches, including Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a hardware solution and leveraging Differential Privacy as software-based tools.

I pursued a joint cybersecurity Master's degree at EPFL and ETH (Switzerland), where I delved into applied cryptography, with a specific focus on Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs). My interest in PETs, particularly Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Multiparty Computation (MPC), has grown steadily, and I have worked in applying such cutting-edge technologies for improving privacy in different scenarios ranging from applications to Machine Learning workflows to 5G Network monitoring.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Torino (Italy), where I graduated with honors.

Outside of work, I maintain an active and fitness-oriented lifestyle as a canoe polo player for 7 years, competing at an agonistic level. Engaging in this sport has instilled in me valuable qualities such as discipline, resilience, and teamwork, benefiting both my personal and professional life.

Additionally, I find joy and a connection to my home country through cooking. Preparing traditional Italian recipes that have been passed down within my family allows me to feel closer to home while nurturing my creativity outside the professional realm.
